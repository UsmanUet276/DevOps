# What is the difference between DevOps and DevSecOps?

**DevOps** is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality.

**DevSecOps** is an extension of DevOps that emphasizes the importance of security throughout the software development lifecycle. DevSecOps teams work together to build secure software from the start, rather than trying to add security on after the fact.

**Here are some of the key differences between DevOps and DevSecOps:**

- **DevOps focuses on collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.** DevSecOps takes this a step further by adding security teams to the mix.
- **DevOps focuses on automating the software development lifecycle.** DevSecOps takes this a step further by automating security testing and remediation.
- **DevOps focuses on delivering high-quality software quickly.** DevSecOps takes this a step further by delivering high-quality, secure software quickly.

**Here are some of the benefits of using DevSecOps:**

- **Increased security:** DevSecOps helps to ensure that security is built into the software from the start, rather than being an afterthought. This can help to reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and breaches.
- **Improved efficiency:** DevSecOps can help to improve the efficiency of the software development lifecycle by automating security testing and remediation. This can free up developers to focus on building features and fixing bugs.
- **Reduced costs:** DevSecOps can help to reduce the costs of security by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities early on. This can prevent costly security breaches and remediation efforts.

**If you are looking for a way to improve the security of your software development lifecycle, DevSecOps is a great option to consider.**
