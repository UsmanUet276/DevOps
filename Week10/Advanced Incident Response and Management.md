# [Advanced Incident Response and Management]([Kubernetes Tutorial | An Introduction To Kubernetes | Edureka](https://www.edureka.co/blog/kubernetes-tutorial/))

## Introduction

- Kubernetes is a platform that automates the deployment of containerized applications, eliminating manual processes.
- Containerization helps developers and testers work in the same environment, avoiding conflicts between different stages of development.

## Challenges Without Container Orchestration

- Scaling containers and managing them together becomes complex and costly in large-scale industries.
- Container Orchestration Systems, like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, help overcome these challenges.

## Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm

- Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are leading container orchestration tools.
- Kubernetes has a larger active community and offers advanced features like auto-scaling and multi-cloud support.
- Docker Swarm has an easier cluster setup but is limited to Docker API capabilities.

## What is Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is an open-source system that schedules containers onto a compute cluster and manages workloads.
- It works well with cloud providers and is a multi-container management solution.

## Kubernetes Features

- Automated Scheduling: Kubernetes schedules containers based on resource requirements and constraints.
- Self-Healing Capabilities: It replaces and reschedules containers when nodes fail and ensures container health.
- Automated Rollouts & Rollbacks: Kubernetes manages application changes and allows rolling back if something goes wrong.
- Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing: It can scale applications based on CPU usage and distribute traffic.

## Kubernetes Architecture

- Master Nodes: Responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster, including API server, controller manager, scheduler, and ETCD.
- Worker/Slave Nodes: Contain necessary services for container networking, communication with the master node, and resource allocation.

## Kubernetes Case-Study

- Yahoo! JAPAN used Kubernetes and Docker in their platform architecture for multi-platform deployment.
- They created an automation toolchain for seamless code deployment, considering factors like multi-tenancy and service discovery.

## Hands-On: Creating a Deployment and Service in Kubernetes

- Step 1: Create a folder and an editor file for the deployment.
- Step 2: Specify deployment specifications in the YAML file.
- Step 3: Apply the deployment using the `kubectl apply -f` command.
- Step 4: Check the list of running pods with `kubectl get pods`.
- Step 5: Create a service using an editor and YAML file.
- Step 6: Specify service specifications in the YAML file.
- Step 7: Apply the service using the `kubectl apply -f` command.
- Step 8: Check if the service is running with `kubectl get svc`.
- Step 9: View the service details with `kubectl describe svc <name>`.
- Step 10: Use `curl` command with the IP address to fetch the webpage and check the output.
