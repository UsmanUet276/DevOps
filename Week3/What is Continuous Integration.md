What is Continuous Integration?

- Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, and verifying those changes with an automated build and testing process.
- The goal of CI is to catch and fix integration issues as early as possible in the development cycle, so that they do not accumulate and cause problems later on.
- CI involves several steps: code changes, automated build, automated tests, and notifications.
- Benefits of CI include early bug detection, improved collaboration, faster time-to-market, reduced risk, and increased confidence.
- CI enables developers to catch and fix bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the time and effort required to fix bugs later on and improving overall software quality.
- CI promotes collaboration between developers by encouraging them to integrate code changes frequently and share their work with others, reducing the risk of silos and improving overall code quality.
- CI enables developers to release new features more quickly and with greater confidence, reducing the risk of costly errors and downtime in production environments.
- By running automated tests on every code change, CI provides developers with greater confidence that their changes have not broken existing functionality, enabling them to release new features more confidently and with less risk.
- By embracing CI, organizations can streamline their development processes and improve overall software quality.
