Here are the essential characteristics of cloud computing:

- **On-demand self-service:** 

  Cloud computing users can provision computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, bandwidth) as needed without requiring human interaction with the service provider. This means that users can quickly and easily scale their resources up or down as needed, without having to worry about managing or provisioning hardware and software themselves.

- **Broad network access:** 

  Cloud computing resources are available over the network and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. This means that users can access their cloud-based applications and data from any device, anywhere in the world.

- **Resource pooling:** 

  Cloud computing providers pool their resources (e.g., servers, storage, bandwidth) and make them available to multiple users. This allows cloud providers to achieve economies of scale and pass those savings on to their users.

- **Rapid elasticity:** 

  Cloud computing resources can be rapidly and easily scaled up or down to meet changing demand. This means that users can pay only for the resources they use, and they can scale their resources up or down as needed to meet their changing needs.

- **Measured service:** 

  Cloud computing providers meter the usage of their resources and charge users based on their usage. This allows users to track their costs and optimize their usage.

These five characteristics are essential to cloud computing because they enable users to access computing resources on demand, from anywhere, and at a cost that is proportional to their usage. These characteristics make cloud computing a powerful and cost-effective way to deliver IT services.

In addition to these five essential characteristics, there are a number of other important characteristics of cloud computing, including:

- **High availability:** 

  Cloud computing providers typically have a high level of availability, meaning that their services are typically available 24/7. This is important for businesses that need to have their applications and data available all the time.

- **Security:** 

  Cloud computing providers have a strong focus on security. They use a variety of security measures to protect their users' data, including encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

- **Compliance:** 

  Cloud computing providers are typically compliant with a variety of industry regulations, such as HIPAA and PCI DSS. This makes them a good choice for businesses that need to comply with these regulations.

Cloud computing is a rapidly growing field, and it is becoming an increasingly popular way to deliver IT services. The five essential characteristics of cloud computing make it a powerful and cost-effective way to access computing resources.
