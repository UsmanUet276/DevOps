# [Advanced Ansible for Configuration Management](https://medium.com/@ubf16371/advanced-ansible-for-configuration-management-a2f761c8233f) 

## What is Configuration Management?

- Managing and maintaining the desired state of systems and applications.
- Ansible simplifies and automates configuration management.

## 1. Ansible Roles

- Organize and encapsulate reusable configuration modules.
- Promote code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.
- Define role dependencies for easy sharing and collaboration.

## 2. Ansible Vault

- Securely encrypt sensitive data within playbooks and configuration files.
- Encrypt variables, files, or entire playbooks.
- Safely version control encrypted files and share with team members.

## 3. Dynamic Inventories

- Dynamically generate inventory of hosts based on external sources.
- Scale infrastructure seamlessly as new hosts are automatically discovered.
- Enhance flexibility and agility of configuration management.

## 4. Ansible Callback Plugins

- Customize and extend Ansible's behavior during playbook execution.
- Collect additional information, generate custom reports, integrate with external systems, or perform custom logging.
- Add advanced logging, notifications, and create custom workflows.

## 5. Ansible Tower

- Web-based interface for managing and scaling Ansible deployments.
- Provides role-based access control, job scheduling, reporting, and centralized logging.
- Enhances manageability and scalability of Ansible configurations.

## Conclusion

- Advanced Ansible techniques enhance configuration management.
- Utilize Ansible roles, vault, dynamic inventories, callback plugins, and Ansible Tower.
- Streamline configuration management, improve code reuse, and enhance security and scalability.
- Ansible empowers efficient and automated configuration management.
