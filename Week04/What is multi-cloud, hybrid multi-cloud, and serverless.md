# What is multi-cloud, hybrid multi-cloud, and serverless?

## Multi-Cloud:

Multi-cloud is a cloud computing approach where an organization uses more than one public cloud service provider to meet their computing needs. The aim of multi-cloud is to avoid vendor lock-in, improve resilience and redundancy, and leverage the unique features of each cloud service provider. Organizations can choose to use different cloud providers for various purposes such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Multi-cloud architecture can be either centralized or decentralized, and it can provide flexibility in terms of service selection and cost optimization.

## Hybrid Multi-Cloud:

Hybrid multi-cloud is an approach where an organization combines multiple cloud services from different vendors, including public clouds and private clouds, to create a unified, flexible, and scalable computing environment. A hybrid multi-cloud architecture allows an organization to leverage the strengths of both public and private clouds, enabling them to optimize workload placement, data governance, and security. A hybrid multi-cloud architecture is designed to allow an organization to move workloads between clouds as necessary, taking advantage of different cloud capabilities and cost structures.

## Serverless:

Serverless is a cloud computing model where the cloud service provider manages the infrastructure required to run the application, and the application code is executed in a stateless environment. The serverless model is based on an event-driven architecture where code runs in response to events such as HTTP requests, database updates, and file uploads. The serverless model allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management. It offers benefits such as scalability, cost optimization, and reduced development time. In serverless computing, the cloud provider charges based on the actual usage of resources, rather than a flat fee, making it a cost-efficient model for organizations.
