# Types of Storage on cloud

Here are some lecture notes on the different types of storage on the cloud:

- **Object Storage:** Object storage is a type of storage that stores data as objects. Objects are typically files or collections of files that are stored in a bucket. Object storage is a good choice for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, and log files.
- **Block Storage:** Block storage is a type of storage that stores data as blocks. Blocks are typically fixed-size chunks of data that are used to store files and applications. Block storage is a good choice for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly, such as databases and virtual machines.
- **File Storage:** File storage is a type of storage that stores data as files. Files are typically stored in a directory structure and can be accessed by users and applications. File storage is a good choice for storing data that needs to be shared between users, such as documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

Each type of storage has its own advantages and disadvantages. Object storage is a good choice for storing large amounts of unstructured data, but it is not as fast as block storage. Block storage is a good choice for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly, but it is more expensive than object storage. File storage is a good choice for storing data that needs to be shared between users, but it is not as scalable as object storage or block storage.

When choosing a type of storage for your cloud environment, you need to consider the following factors:

- The amount of data you need to store
- The type of data you need to store
- The speed at which you need to access the data
- The cost of storage
- The scalability of storage

By considering these factors, you can choose the right type of storage for your cloud environment.
