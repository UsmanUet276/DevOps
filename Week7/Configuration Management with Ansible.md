# [Configuration Management with Ansible](https://usman-devops.hashnode.dev/configuration-management-with-ansible)

## Introduction to Ansible

- Ansible is an open-source automation tool for configuration management.
- It follows a declarative approach to manage and configure systems.
- Playbooks, written in YAML format, define the desired state of systems.

## Key Concepts in Ansible

### Inventory

- An inventory file lists the target systems or hosts managed by Ansible.
- Systems can be organized into groups, and variables can be assigned to hosts or groups.

### Playbooks

- Playbooks are the core of Ansible and define tasks to be executed on target systems.
- Tasks describe specific actions such as package installation, service management, or file copying.

### Tasks

- Tasks are individual units of work within a playbook.
- They represent specific actions to be performed on target systems.
- Tasks can include commands, module invocations, or the inclusion of other playbooks or roles.

### Roles

- Roles organize and reuse playbooks and tasks in Ansible.
- They group related tasks together, making playbooks more modular and maintainable.
- Roles can be shared across projects and published on Ansible Galaxy.

## Getting Started with Ansible

1. Install Ansible on the control machine.
2. Define an inventory file listing the target systems to be managed.
3. Create a playbook specifying the tasks to be performed.
4. Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command with the inventory and playbook files.

## Example Playbook: Installing Nginx

- Walkthrough of a playbook that installs Nginx on target systems.
- Playbook includes tasks for updating package cache, installing Nginx, and starting the Nginx service.
- Use of the `apt` module for package management on Debian-based systems.

## Conclusion

- Ansible simplifies and automates configuration management tasks.
- Playbooks define the desired state of systems and enable consistent management.
- Ansible is suitable for both small-scale and large-scale infrastructure management.
- Start using Ansible to experience the benefits of efficient and automated configuration management.
