# [Microservices Architecture]([What are microservices?](https://microservices.io/))

## Introduction to Microservices

- Microservices architecture is an architectural style for building applications.
- It structures an application as a collection of independent, loosely coupled services.
- Each service is owned by a small team and focuses on a specific business capability.
- Microservices enable rapid, frequent, reliable, and sustainable software delivery.

## Enabling Rapid, Frequent, and Reliable Software Delivery

### Success Triangle

- Rapid, frequent, and reliable software delivery is crucial for businesses to thrive.
- The success triangle comprises three elements:
  - Process: DevOps practices as defined by the DevOps handbook.
  - Organization: Small, cross-functional teams working independently.
  - Architecture: Loosely coupled, testable, and deployable architecture.

## When to Consider Microservices

### Outgrowing Monolithic Architecture

- Monolithic architecture can be sufficient for rapid software delivery with the right practices.
- However, as an application grows large and complex, it can become a bottleneck.
- Consider migrating to microservices when the monolithic architecture impedes rapid delivery.

## Designing a Microservices Architecture

### Importance of Service Architecture

- Picking technologies is important, but designing a good service architecture is critical.
- Design services, define their responsibilities, APIs, and collaborations.
- A well-designed service architecture prevents the creation of a distributed monolith.

### Assemblage Process

- Assemblage is an architecture definition process for microservices.
- It identifies system operations, subdomains, and leverages dark energy and dark matter forces.
- Groups subdomains into services and designs distributed system operations.

### Microservices Pattern Language

- The Microservices pattern language provides guidance for technical architecture design.
- It helps in making design decisions and creating an effective microservices architecture.

## Migrating from Monolith to Microservices

### Principles for Migration

- Incremental migration using patterns like Stranger Fig, avoiding big bang rewrites.
- Validate design decisions early and deliver new functionality gradually.

### Avoiding Adoption Antipatterns

- Be aware of common antipatterns that can hinder successful microservices adoption.

## Conclusion

- Microservices architecture enables rapid, frequent, and reliable software delivery.
- Consider migrating to microservices when monolithic architecture becomes a bottleneck.
- Designing a well-structured microservices architecture is essential for success.
- Use the Assemblage process and Microservices pattern language for effective design.
- Incrementally migrate and avoid adoption antipatterns for a successful transition.
