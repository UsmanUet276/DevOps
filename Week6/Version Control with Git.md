## [Version Control with Git](https://usman-devops.hashnode.dev/version-control-with-git)

- Version control is a system for managing and tracking changes to files and folders over time in software development.
- Git is a distributed version control system known for its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful features.
- Key concepts in Git include repositories, commits, branches, merges, and remotes.
- Repositories store the project's files and their versions, and can be local or hosted remotely.
- Commits represent snapshots of changes made to the repository, with unique identifiers and descriptive messages.
- Branches allow developers to work on different features or fixes independently, keeping the main codebase unaffected.
- Merging integrates changes from one branch into another, ensuring compatibility between the sets of changes.
- Remotes are copies of the repository hosted on a server, facilitating collaboration between multiple developers.
- To get started with Git, install Git on your machine and initialize a repository with `git init`.
- Add and commit changes using `git add <filename>` and `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
- Create and switch branches with `git branch <branch-name>` and `git checkout <branch-name>`.
- Merge branches using `git merge <source-branch>` and resolve any conflicts that arise.
- Collaborate with remote repositories by connecting them to your local repository using `git remote add origin <remote-repo-url>` and pushing changes with `git push`.

By understanding the basics of Git and following these steps, you can effectively manage your code changes, collaborate with others, and enhance your development workflow.
