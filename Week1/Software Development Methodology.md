# Software Development Methodology :arrows_clockwise:

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software development teams to design, develop, and test high-quality software products. The SDLC consists of several stages, each of which plays a vital role in delivering software products that meet customer requirements.

## Explanation 

1. **Planning:** In this stage, the software development team defines the scope of the project, identifies the goals and objectives, and outlines the project plan.
2. **Requirements Gathering:** In this stage, the software development team gathers and documents the software requirements. The requirements can be functional or non-functional and are gathered from stakeholders, including end-users, customers, and subject matter experts.
3. **Design:** In this stage, the software development team creates a detailed design of the software system. The design phase involves creating architecture, flowcharts, data models, and other diagrams that outline how the software will function.
4. **Development:** In this stage, the software development team writes code and creates the software application based on the design created in the previous phase.
5. **Testing:** In this stage, the software development team tests the software application to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions as intended. Testing can include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
6. **Deployment:** In this stage, the software application is deployed to a production environment. This can involve installing the software on customer machines, deploying it to a server, or publishing it to an app store.
7. **Maintenance:** In this stage, the software development team provides ongoing support and maintenance for the software application. This can include bug fixes, updates, and enhancements based on customer feedback.



## Conclusion

The SDLC is a continuous process that involves iterating through each stage until the software application is considered complete. Each stage of the SDLC is critical to delivering high-quality software that meets customer needs and requirements.
