### Waterfall Methodology

The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach that follows a specific set of phases in a fixed order. These phases include requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and maintenance. Once a phase is completed, the team moves on to the next phase. The Waterfall approach is well-suited for projects where requirements are well-defined, and changes are minimal. However, it can be inflexible when it comes to accommodating changes and feedback during the development process.

### Agile

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that involves collaboration, flexibility, and a focus on delivering value to the customer. Instead of completing each phase before moving on to the next, Agile development works in sprints, where the team delivers a working product incrementally at the end of each sprint. The Agile approach is well-suited for projects with dynamic requirements, where changes and feedback are frequent, and a high degree of flexibility is required.

# Agile vs Waterfall Methodology

Agile and Waterfall are two different software development methodologies that differ in their approach to managing a software development project. Here are some key differences between Agile and Waterfall:

1. **Approach:** Waterfall follows a linear approach, while Agile is iterative and incremental.
2. **Requirements:** Waterfall requires complete and detailed requirements, while Agile allows for flexibility and changes.
3. **Flexibility:** Waterfall is inflexible, while Agile is flexible and adaptable to changes.
4. **Delivery:** Waterfall delivers the entire product at the end, while Agile delivers a working product incrementally.
5. **Collaboration:** Agile emphasizes collaboration and communication, while Waterfall involves a more structured approach.
